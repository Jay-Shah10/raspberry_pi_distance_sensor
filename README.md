## How to
<strong>How to set up Raspberry Pi 3 B+</strong>
1. You first want to install Raspian from [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/).
2. Then you need to intall a program that allows you to copy and install the image on
a micro SD card. I used Win32DiskImager for windows 10.
3. Once your image has been successfully installed on the micro SD card, you can insert it in th PI and boot it.
4. You should now be able to connect it to your wifi.
5. Enable SSH, so you can accesss your PI remotely.
